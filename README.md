# Intents Framework

## Description

The Intents Framework is a modular and interoperable system designed to interpret and execute user intents on any ENV-compatible blockchain. It leverages a combination of smart contracts, solvers, and an optional UI component to provide a comprehensive solution for decentralized intent management.

## Features

- **Modular Components**: Easily interchangeable modules including smart contracts, solvers, and UI components.
- **EIP-7683 Compliance**: Ensures compatibility and standardization across Ethereum blockchain.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Facilitates operations across multiple blockchain platforms.

## Directory Structure

- `solidity/` - Contains the smart contract code written in Solidity.
- `typescript/solvers/` - Houses the TypeScript implementations of the solvers that execute the intents.
